## Introduction

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) is an open-source continuous integration and continuous delivery tool, which can be used to automate building, testing and deploying software. It is widely considered the most popular automation server, being used by more than 1,000,000 users worldwide. Advantages of Jenkins include:
- open source, with huge community support
- Java based, making it portable to all major platforms
- Rich plugin ecosystem (more than 1000) 

It provides support for all popular Source Control Management systems (Git, SVN, Mercurial and CVS), popular build tools (Ant, Maven, Grunt), shell scripts or Windows batch commands, as well as testing frameworks and report generators. Jenkins plugins provide support (among many others) for technologies like **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, which enable the creation and deployment of cloud-based microservice environments, both for testing as well as production deployments. 

Jenkins supports the master-slave architecture (many slaves/nodes/build servers work for a master) making it highly **scalable**. The master's job is to handle scheduling build jobs, distributing the jobs to slaves for actual execution, monitor the slaves and get the build results. It can also execute build job directly. The job of the slaves is to build the job distributed by the master. A job can be configured to run on a particular type of slave, or if no specifications are needed you can let Jenkins pick the next available slave.

Jenkins scalability gives you lots of benefits:
- ability to run many build plans in parallel
- automatically spinning up and removing slaves based on need, which saves costs
- distributing the load

Even if the scalability feature is available in Jenkins out-of-the-box, the process of making Jenkins scalable is not straightforward. There are plenty of options available to implement Jenkins scaling. One of the powerful options available right now is Jenkins scaling on top of Kubernetes.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open source containers orchestration tool, managing containers on which applications run. Its main purpose is to manage containerized applications in a cluster of nodes and to facilitate their deployment, scaling, updating, maintenance or service discovery. More details about what Kubernetes is, what it can do, you can find out from the official documentation [page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes).

Kubernetes is one of the best tools for managing scalable solutions. Almost every application can be containerized, Jenkins too, and thatâ€™s why it makes Kubernetes a very nice option to use.

## Hands on

Before starting, let's take a moment and describe what we want to accomplish. We want to create a Kubernetes cluster and on top to deploy Jenkins Master. We will use `kubernetes` plugin (currently version [1.13.0](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin)) to implement Jenkins scaling on top of this cluster by running dynamic agents. The plugin will create a Kubernetes Pod for each agent started defined by the Docker image to run, and will stop it after each build. Agents will be launched using JNLP, so it is expected that the image will connect automatically to the Jenkins master. 

**Prerequisites and Setup**
- GCP account, free tier is enough
- Kubernetes cluster, this demo uses GCP's GKE but any other [provider](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-provisioning/hosted-kubernetes-clusters/) works the same
- Linux box where Rancher will be running (also will be used to build custom Jenkins images)
- docker hub account, to push these custom images (master and slave)

Let's start by building our own custom images and then push them to [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com). We will use for this docker, which can be installed following this [tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/).

Once installed we need to prepare our [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

FROM jenkins/jnlp-slave

COPY jenkins-slave /usr/local/bin/jenkins-slave

# For testing purpose only
COPY empty-test-file /usr/local/bin/jenkins-slave2

ENTRYPOINT ["jenkins-slave"]
```

OBS1: `jenkins-slave` script can be downloaded from the official GitHub repo of [jenkinsci/docker-jnlp-slave](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-jnlp-slave).

OBS2: `empty-test-file`, file needed to be present in same folder as docker files, will be used for testing; for first Docker Slave JNLP image will be copied as `jenkins-slave1`, for second one as `jenkins-slave2`.

Once these files are ready we can build and push the images to hub.

```bash
[root@rancher-instance jenkins-kubernetes]# docker build -f Dockerfile-jenkins-master -t jenkins-master .
```

You will need to repeat same commands in order to build the two images for the Jenkins JNLP slaves.

```
docker build -f Dockerfile-jenkins-slave-jnlp1 -t jenkins-slave-jnlp1 .
docker tag jenkins-slave-jnlp1 calinrus/jenkins-slave-jnlp1
docker push calinrus/jenkins-slave-jnlp1

docker build -f Dockerfile-jenkins-slave-jnlp2 -t jenkins-slave-jnlp2 .
docker tag jenkins-slave-jnlp2 calinrus/jenkins-slave-jnlp2
docker push calinrus/jenkins-slave-jnlp2
```

If everything went fine in your docker hub account you should see something like this:

## Starting a Rancher 2.0 instance

Let's start now a Rancher 2.0 instance, that will help us deploy a GKE cluster. There is a very intuitive getting started guide for this purpose [here](https://rancher.com/quick-start/). Letâ€™s create a hosted Kubernetes cluster and wait for it to turn `Active`. As soon as it's ready we can deploy Jenkins master (based on the image we just built) and create some services. If you are familiar with `kubectl` you can achieve this from command line, otherwise you can use Rancher's UI.

```

From Rancher, click on your managed cluster (called `jenkins` in this demo), go to Workloads tab, select the (local) file and hit Import. Wait for the Workload to finish.

![03](images/03-rancher-deploy-workloads-from-yaml.png)
![04](images/04-rancher-import.png)
![06](images/06-rancher-workload-progress-done.png)

We need a way to access Jenkins master (UI) instance. For this we need to create some services. One service will be created as a LoadBalancer, so we will get a public IP to access Jenkins from Internet, the other one will be a ClusterIP needed for internal communication between master and (future) slaves.
In `Load Balancing` tab follow same process, hit Import YAML, select the file containing our services and Import it.

![07](images/07-rancher-load-balancing.png)
![08](images/08-rancher-load-balancing-status.png)

Wait a bit for the public IP as it gets created. As soon as service turns `Active` you can find it by clicking on the `three vertical dots` at the right end of the page and select `View/Edit YAML`

![09](images/09-rancher-get-public-IP.png)

We can access now Jenkins UI from browser, in this example using http://35.237.39.166

![10](images/10-rancher-jenkins-first-access.png)

Under `Build Executor Status` we see two executors being idle, waiting to pick up build jobs. These are coming from Jenkins Master. Since we don't want our master instance to perform build jobs we will disable them. Master instance should be in charge only with scheduling build jobs, distributing the jobs to slaves for actual execution, monitor the slaves and get the build results.
Click on `Manage Jenkins -> Manage Nodes`. Click `Configure` and set `# of executors` to 0. Hit on `Save` and observe that the executors have been removed.

![13](images/13-rancher-jenkins-manage-nodes.png)
![14_1](images/14_1-rancher-jenkins-master-configure.png)
![14_2](images/14_2-rancher-jenkins-master-remove-executors.png)

Click on `Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins` and let's check that we have the three plugins installed, the ones from Dockerfile-jenkins-master, most important here is to check the presence of `Kubernetes` plugin. We can see here, that our version, 1.13.0 is installed.

![11](images/11-rancher-jenkins-manage-plugins.png)
![12](images/12-rancher-jenkins-check-plugins.png)

Let's configure now the plugin. For this we need to go in `Manage Jenkins -> Configure System`. Scroll this page to bottom, you will see there the `Cloud` section. Click on `Add a new cloud` and let's start filling the needed information.

![18](images/18-rancher-jenkins-configure-system.png)
![19](images/19-rancher-jenkins-cloud.png)
![20-1](images/20-rancher-jenkins-cloud-1.png)

As you see in the above screenshot, fields that need to be filled are:
- Name
- Kubernetes URL
- Credentials
- Jenkins tunnel

Kubernetes URL and Credentials (which you will need to add them by clicking on the `Add` button) you can get from GCP console. As soon as you added the credentials, test the connection by clicking `Test Connection`, it should return Connection Test Successful. Jenkins tunnel you can take it from `Service Discovery` tab from Rancher.

![16](images/16-rancher-gke-show-credentials.png)
![17](images/17-rancher-gke-get-credentials.png)
![20-3](images/20-rancher-jenkins-cloud-3.png)

Scroll down as we need to add a `Kubernetes Pod Template` and a `Container Template` for the two Jenkins Slave types which we'll use (remember that we have pushed two slave images to docker hub). Click on `Add Pod Template` and fill in the needed information.

Most important thing to follow here:
- labels, they will be different for the two type of Pods: `jenkins-slave-jnlp1` and `jenkins-slave-jnlp2`
- container name, this is mandatory to be set to `jnlp`. (in order to replace the [default JNLP agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-slave/), the name of the container with the custom JNLP image must be jnlp)
- make sure that you remove the pre-filled info from `Command to run` and `Arguments to pass to the command` and leave the two empty.

![21](images/21-rancher-jenkins-pod-template-1.png)
![22](images/22-rancher-jenkins-pod-template-2.png)

Now we are all set up. Configuration is done so we can create some build jobs to see the power of Jenkins scaling on top of Kubernetes. We will create 5 build jobs for the first image (the one containing `jenkins-slave1` file). In order to enforce build jobs to spin the image we want, we will use Jenkins `Label Expression`. As soon as you fill in the name of the expression you will see a message that the label is serviced by a cloud, the one we configured.

![23](images/23-racher-jenkins-job1.png)
![24](images/24-rancher-jenkins-label-expression.png)
![25](images/25-rancher-jenkins-shell-1.png)

Perform same steps as above, just change the `Label Expression` to match the second image, value in this case should be `jenkins-slave-jnlp2`. Check here as well to use Ansicolor (just adds some color to console output) and fill in the bash commands.

![26](images/26-rancher-jenkins-shell-2.png)

Go to the home screen and start all the ten jobs you just created. As soon as you start them, they will be queued, check them under the `Build Queue` section.

![28](images/28-rancher-jenkins-start-jobs.png)

Takes few seconds and Pods are starting to be created (you can check Rancher's `Workload` tab), therefor executors/slaves are getting attached to the master which instructs them to start processing the queued jobs.

![29](images/29-rancher-jenkins-executors.png)
![30](images/30-rancher-workloads-executors.png)

As soon as executors finish the jobs, they are being removed, so Pods are not available in cluster anymore.

![31](images/31-rancher-remove-pods.png)

To check the status of our build jobs we can randomly pick one from each side. As expected the first jobs have used our first image containing `jenkins-slave1` file, while the other jobs have used the second image containing `jenkins-slave2` file.

![32](images/32-rancher-test-results-1.png)
![33](images/33-rancher-test-results-2.png)

Congratulations! If youâ€™ve reached this point, you've seen the true power of Jenkins auto-scaling inside the Kubernetes cluster!

## Conclusion

Let's recap our exercise:
- we created a clusters using Rancher
- we created custom docker images for Jenkins master and slaves
- we deployed Jenkins master and created a L4 service LoadBalancer
- we configured `kubernetes` plugin so we can have dynamic agents in our Kubernetes cluster.
- we tested a scenarios using a number of build jobs

The main scope behind this article was to highlight the basic configuration for setting up Jenkins Master and Slave architecture. We saw how agents are launched using JNLP and how the image connects automatically to the Jenkins master. To achieve this we used [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) to create the cluster, deploy a workload and then monitor the Pods. Of course the most important piece in this puzzle was [kubernetes plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin) which glues everything so well together.
